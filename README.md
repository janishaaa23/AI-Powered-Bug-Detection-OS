# 🚀 AI Powered Bug Detection OS

## 📌 Overview

The **AI Powered Bug Detection OS** is a cutting-edge operating system designed to **detect, analyze, and optimize software debugging** using artificial intelligence. By integrating machine learning models, it proactively identifies software vulnerabilities, streamlines debugging, and enhances system security. 

## 🌟 Features

🔍 **AI-driven Bug Detection**: Automatically scans and detects software bugs in real-time using ML algorithms.

⚙️ **System Resource Monitor**: Provides real-time CPU, memory, and disk usage analysis for optimized performance.

📊 **Process Management**: Implements scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin for efficient multitasking.

🖥️ **Memory Management**: Simulates paging, segmentation, and dynamic allocation strategies.

📂 **File Handling**: Supports system calls and file operations for managing resources efficiently.

🔄 **Multi-threading Support**: Enables concurrent process execution for enhanced efficiency.

🖥️ **User-friendly Interface**: Includes a CLI and an interactive dashboard for monitoring system activities.

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Powered Bug Detection OS:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ai-Powered-Bug-Detection-OS.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Ai-Powered-Bug-Detection-OS
   ```
3. **Compile the Source Code (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o ai_bug_detector -pthread
   ```
4. **Run the System:**
   ```bash
   ./ai_bug_detector
   ```

## 🚀 How It Works

The AI Powered Bug Detection OS follows a structured workflow to detect and resolve software bugs:

1. **User Input**: The user uploads a program or selects a system operation.
2. **AI Analysis**: The integrated machine learning model scans the code for potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.
3. **Processing**: The simulator processes the request using implemented OS algorithms.
4. **Execution**: The system executes the requested operation and provides insights or debugging suggestions.
5. **Loop/Exit**: The user can choose to reanalyze, modify the code, or exit the system.

## 📊 System Resource Monitor

The AI Powered Bug Detection OS includes a **real-time system monitor** to track performance metrics such as:

- **CPU Usage**: Displays processor usage percentage and active processes.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors RAM consumption and available resources.
- **Disk Usage**: Keeps track of storage capacity and allocation.
- **Top CPU-Intensive Processes**: Lists active processes consuming the most system resources.
