🚀 **AI-Powered Bug Detection OS**
An intelligent system that monitors, detects, and fixes bugs in real-time using AI.

📌 **Project Overview**
The AI-Powered Bug Detection OS is designed to enhance system stability and performance by monitoring system behavior, detecting anomalies, and suggesting automatic fixes. It leverages machine learning and automation to predict failures, troubleshoot issues, and provide community-driven bug reporting.

🛠️ **Features**

1️⃣ System Monitoring & Bug Detection

✅ Real-time tracking of CPU, RAM, Disk, and Network usage

✅ Log scanning to detect errors and crashes

✅ Process monitoring to find applications consuming excessive resources

✅ Anomaly detection to alert about unusual behavior



2️⃣ AI-Powered Bug Fixing & Troubleshooting

✅ Predictive maintenance alerts before failures occur

✅ AI-generated suggestions for fixes

✅ Self-healing mechanism (auto-restart services if needed)

✅ Bug classification (performance issues, security bugs, app crashes)



3️⃣ Community-Driven Bug Reporting & Data Visualization

✅ Automated bug reports with detailed logs

✅ Users can submit bugs manually

✅ Data visualization dashboard (graphs showing system health & errors)

✅ Community-driven solutions for unresolved issues
