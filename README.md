# AI-Powered-Bug-Detection-OS
An operating system that incorporates AI to monitor system performance and application behavior in real-time, automatically detecting and suggesting fixes for bugs or performance issues. Potential Features: Predictive maintenance alerts, automated troubleshooting guides, and a community-driven bug reporting system.

📌 Project Overview
**Goal:**
 Develop an AI-powered Bug Detection OS that monitors system performance and application behavior in real-time, detecting and suggesting fixes for bugs or performance issues.

**Expected Outcomes:**
Real-time System Monitoring: AI detects unusual behavior (high CPU usage, memory leaks, crashes, etc.).

Automated Bug Fix Suggestions: AI recommends fixes based on past issues.

Bug Reporting System: A community-driven platform where users report bugs and solutions.

🚀 **Key Features of AI-Powered Bug Detection OS**
Your AI-Powered Bug Detection OS will continuously monitor system performance and application behavior in real time, automatically detecting bugs and suggesting fixes. Below are the key features categorized by different modules:

1️⃣ System Monitoring & Bug Detection Module
🔍 Real-time Monitoring & Bug Detection
✅ System Performance Analysis – Tracks CPU, RAM, Disk usage & Network activity.
✅ Anomaly Detection – AI detects unusual system behavior (e.g., memory leaks, excessive CPU usage).
✅ Log Analysis – Scans system logs for errors, crashes, and warnings.
✅ Process Tracking – Identifies problematic applications causing system slowdowns.

📌 Example: If an app starts consuming excessive memory, the AI will alert and suggest restarting it.

2️⃣ AI-Powered Bug Fixing & Troubleshooting Module
🤖 AI-Powered Issue Diagnosis & Suggestions
✅ Automated Bug Classification – Categorizes issues (performance, security, crashes).
✅ Predictive Maintenance Alerts – Warns users before failures occur.
✅ Auto-Generated Fix Suggestions – Uses AI to suggest code or system-level fixes.
✅ Self-Healing Mechanism – OS can attempt auto-fixes (e.g., restarting a crashed service).

📌 Example: If a program is crashing due to a memory leak, the AI suggests reducing memory allocation or garbage collection techniques.

3️⃣ Community-Driven Bug Reporting & Visualization Module
🌐 Bug Reporting & Data Visualization
✅ Automated Bug Reports – Generates detailed reports of detected bugs.
✅ User Feedback & Bug Submission – Allows users to report unidentified issues.
✅ Data Visualization Dashboard – Graphs showing system health, errors, and patterns.
✅ Collaborative Fixing – Community can vote on best solutions for unresolved issues.

📌 Example: Users can submit error logs, and AI prioritizes frequent issues for community fixes.
